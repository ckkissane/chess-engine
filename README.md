# chess-engine
A chess engine in C++. You can play moves by typing "move" and then the move in long notation (ex: "move e2e4"). 
If you want to compute the best move, input "go".
The program uses a modification of the "minimax" algorithm to search for a good move, and plays it for you. 
"Alpha beta pruning" is applied to the algorithm to prune the search for the best move.
